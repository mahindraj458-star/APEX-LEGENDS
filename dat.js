            "story": "The Toyota AE86 Sprinter Trueno was born during a technological shift where most compact platforms moved to front-wheel drive. Toyota chose to preserve the rear-wheel-drive formula for this chassis, unintentionally creating one of the most influential enthusiast cars in history.\n\nPowered by the high-revving 4A-GE engine and weighing under 1,000 kg, the AE86 delivered pure mechanical feedback. Its balanced chassis and predictable oversteer made it a natural fit for touge racing and grassroots drifting in Japan.\n\nIts global cult status exploded through Initial D, where the panda-liveried Trueno became a symbol of driver skill over horsepower. From mountain roads to professional drift circuits, the AE86 evolved from an affordable coupe into a collector-grade icon.\n\nToday, surviving examples are highly sought after, restored, modified, and preserved as artifacts of analog performance engineering.",
