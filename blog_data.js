    "excerpt": "Mahindra has built its legacy on icons like the Thar and Scorpio. Now, the brand is rewriting its identity with the Born Electric (BE) lineup—futuristic SUVs powered by the new INGLO platform, infused with German EV engineering, and even scored by A.R. Rahman. This is not just evolution. It’s a revolution.",
    "content": "The Core Update: The “BE” Lineup\n\nMahindra isn’t simply adding electric variants to its portfolio. It has created a dedicated EV sub-brand: BE (Born Electric).\n\nLeading the charge is the Mahindra BE.05 — a bold, sport-focused SUV that looks like it drove straight out of a sci-fi movie. With its fighter-jet inspired cockpit and “Heartcore” design language, the BE.05 signals a radical shift. Sharp lines, aggressive lighting, and a digital-first interior redefine what an Indian SUV can look like.\n\nNext is the Mahindra XUV.e9, the fully electric coupe-SUV sibling inspired by the Mahindra XUV700. Its standout feature? A stunning triple-screen dashboard that stretches across the entire width of the cabin—transforming the driving experience into something immersive and futuristic.\n\nThis isn’t just about replacing engines with batteries. It’s about reimagining the SUV.\n\nThe INGLO Platform: The Spine of the Future\n\nAt the heart of this revolution lies Mahindra’s new INGLO platform. Think of it as the spine supporting all future BE models.\n\nWhat makes it even more exciting is its connection to the Volkswagen MEB platform. By incorporating components rooted in German EV engineering, Mahindra’s new electric SUVs blend Indian ambition with proven global technology.\n\nThe result?\n\nHigh-capacity battery options\n\nFast-charging capability\n\nAdvanced driver assistance systems\n\nDual-motor AWD setups delivering over 250 kW of power\n\nPerformance expectations are equally bold. The BE models aim for 0–100 km/h in just 5–6 seconds—a figure unimaginable for a Mahindra SUV a decade ago.\n\nFrom Torque to Kilowatts\n\nTraditionally, Mahindra pride was measured in diesel torque—especially from the mHawk engines powering the Scorpio. Today, that conversation shifts to instant electric thrust.\n\nElectric motors deliver power instantly. No turbo lag. No gear shifts. Just seamless acceleration.\n\nThe BE series transforms Mahindra’s identity:\n\nFrom diesel growl to electric pulse\n\nFrom mechanical ruggedness to cyber-tough styling\n\nFrom analog dials to immersive digital interfaces\n\nThe rugged spirit remains—but it now wears a futuristic suit.\n\nThe Sound of the Future\n\nIn a move that blends engineering with art, Mahindra collaborated with music legend A. R. Rahman to craft the sonic identity of the BE lineup.\n\nElectric cars are silent by nature. Instead of engine noise, the BE models feature a custom-composed “pulse” that evolves as you accelerate. It’s not just transportation—it’s an experience scored like a cinematic moment.\n\nCape Town Reveal: Legends Reborn\n\nAt a global showcase in Cape Town, Mahindra didn’t just present the BE lineup. It unveiled bold concept vehicles like the “Global Pik Up” and the electric rebirth of its most iconic nameplate—the Mahindra Thar.e.\n\nThe Thar.e is a modular, five-door electric off-roader that proves even the toughest legends are ready for reinvention. It retains the DNA of the original Thar but evolves it for an electric world.\n\nRugged to Digital: The Big Shift\n\nMahindra’s past was defined by metal, mud, and muscle.\nIts future is defined by code, connectivity, and clean energy.\n\nYet the brand hasn’t abandoned its roots. Instead, it is translating rugged reliability into a new language—cyber-tough design, advanced software systems, and global EV architecture.\n\nThe message is clear:\nMahindra is no longer just building SUVs for India.\nIt’s building electric SUVs for the world.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe transition from Thar to Thar.e, from Scorpio torque to BE kilowatts, marks one of the boldest transformations in Indian automotive history.\n\nThe BE lineup isn’t just a product launch. It’s a statement.\n\nMahindra’s legends built the past.\nIts Born Electric vision is shaping the future.",

    "title": "Timeless Wheels: How Vintage Cars Are Captivating a New Generation",
    "excerpt": "While the auto industry races toward electrification and high tech, automotive heritage is alive and spectacular. This February, vintage car rallies and classic car events from India to Europe are celebrating automotive history—reminding us that every new innovation still drives on the legacy of yesterday’s machines.",
    "content": "The Full Blog\n\nAt a time when electric vehicles and tech-packed SUVs dominate headlines, something wonderfully old-school is rolling back into focus: classic cars.\n\nFrom India’s ghats to Paris’ grand halls, February 2026 has become a month that celebrates automotive history—not just future-forward innovations.\n\nVintage Fiat Rally: A Drive Through History\n\nIn Pune, Maharashtra, over 20 vintage Fiat cars—some dating all the way back to 1955—made headlines as they rolled through city streets and scenic ghats en route to Mahabaleshwar.\n\nModels like the classic Millicento, Superselect, President, and Padmini weren’t just relics on display—they were living machines, lovingly restored and driven like they were meant to be. For many owners, maintaining these vehicles is a labor of love, involving hard-to-find parts and hands-on restoration work.\n\nThis rally wasn’t about speed or performance. It was community, passion, and the joy of watching automotive history come alive on the road.\n\nRétromobile: 50 Years of Automotive Heritage in Paris\n\nIt isn’t just India embracing its classics. In Europe, one of the most iconic automotive shows—Rétromobile in Paris—marked its 50th anniversary in early February.\n\nThis isn’t your ordinary car show. Rétromobile is a global celebration of automotive history, with hundreds of vintage vehicles, rare prototypes, and historic race cars on display. Enthusiasts, collectors, and curious visitors come together to honor the machines that shaped motoring over a century.\n\nFrom early 20th-century classics to mid-century design icons, the event brings dozens of eras together under one roof—proving that while the auto industry moves forward, there’s always room to look back with reverence and joy.\n\nWhy These Events Matter\n\nYou might be wondering: Why is heritage suddenly such a big deal?\n\nHere’s what these gatherings remind us:\n\n1. Cars Tell Stories\nEach classic vehicle carries history—not just mechanical design, but cultural context, memories, and personal journeys shared by owners and families.\n\n2. Legacy Inspires Innovation\nModern tech—from EVs to advanced safety systems—exists because engineers once wrestled with carburetors, steel frames, and mechanical simplicity. Seeing the past in motion helps us appreciate how far automotive engineering has come and where it might go next.\n\n3. They Build Community\nEvents like the Fiat rally or Rétromobile bring people together—old friends, new fans, and even young enthusiasts who might otherwise only know cars from video games or screens.\n\nWhat the Future Holds\n\nWhile events celebrating old cars remind us of where we started, this year’s global auto scene is also buzzing with what’s coming next—from new EV launches in India to cutting-edge concept reveals around the world.\n\nIt’s like two worlds coexisting:\n\nThe nostalgic beauty of timeless machines\n\nThe electric, digital future racing toward tomorrow\n\nWhether you’re a classic car buff or a tech-savvy EV fan, this juxtaposition makes 2026 one of the most exciting years in automotive history.\n\nClosing Thought\n\nAt a vintage rally or a glitzy tech reveal, cars continue to do what they’ve always done: captivate our imagination.\n\nFrom the roar of a classic engine on a scenic ghat road to the hum of an EV on a city street, the journey of the automobile is as thrilling as the destination.",
